1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Two values of boolean datatype are – TRUE and FALSE
a = True
type(a)

output – ‘bool’
 
 b = False
type(b)

output – ‘bool’


2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Different types of Boolean operators are –
AND
OR
NOT

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator’s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
		AND	OR
TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE
TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

	NOT
TRUE	FALSE
FALSE	TRUE

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)   -- False
not (5 > 4)   -- False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)   -- True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))  -- False
(True and True) and (True == False)  -- False
(not False) or (not True)       --  True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
==
>
<
!=
>=
<=



6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

Equal to operator is used to check if the values on the both sides are equal or not whereas assignment operator assign a value.
Example-
 Equal to operator – 
      3==3
Assignment operator –
   a=11

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:    #block 1
     print(“eggs”)
if spam > 5:       #block 2
    print(“bacon”)
else:                   #block 3
    print(”ham”)
    print(“spam”)
    print(“spam”)
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = int(input("enter an integer value"))
if spam==1:
    print("Hello")
if spam==2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?

Ctrl + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Break statement immediately exits the loop whereas continue will move on to the next iteration.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Range(10) will contain values from 0 to 10 excluding 10.
Range(0,10) will start from 0 and continue till 10 excluding 10.
Range(0,10,1) will start from 0 and continue till 10 excluding 10 with an step size of 1 i.e. will jump one step.
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
for i in range(1,11):
      print(i, end=” “)

i = 1
while(i<=10):
    print(i)
    i += 1
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
  spam.bacon()
